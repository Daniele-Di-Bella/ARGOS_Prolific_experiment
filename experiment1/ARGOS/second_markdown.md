# TMEM114

**TMEM114** (Transmembrane Protein 114) is a gene that encodes a membrane-associated protein and has attracted attention due to its significant role in eye development, especially regarding its potential involvement in congenital cataracts. This article explores TMEM114’s genetic relationships, structure, predicted functions, cellular localization, and known protein interactions, with a particular focus on its relevance to eye physiology and disease.

## Discovery and Genetic Relationships

TMEM114 was first identified during the study of a familial chromosomal translocation associated with congenital cataract. Researchers mapped the translocation breakpoint to the TMEM114 gene region on chromosome 16, implicating this gene in eye development and lens transparency [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Subsequent studies have shown that the gene encodes a protein consisting of 223 amino acids, placing TMEM114 in the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 superfamily, which includes proteins typically containing four transmembrane helices [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\TMEM114\Interstitial deletion at chromosome 16p13.2 involving TMEM114 (transmembrane protein 114) in a boy and his father without cataract.pdf]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TMEM114 is more closely related to the voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma subunits (CACNGs) than to classic claudins, which are well-known tight junction proteins [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

A homologous gene, **TMEM235**, is closely related to TMEM114, sharing both functional and structural similarities. However, TMEM114 and TMEM235 form a distinct branch within the CACNG subfamily of the Pfam00822 protein family, setting them apart from the claudins and other related protein families [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

## Structure and Predicted Mechanism

TMEM114 encodes a protein featuring four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, a structural motif conserved throughout the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf]. The first extracellular loop contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites, which are essential for the protein’s proper localization to the plasma membrane. Experimental evidence confirms that mutations or enzymatic removal of these glycosylation sites result in mislocalization of TMEM114, highlighting their importance [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

TMEM114 shares significant sequence similarity with the lens intrinsic membrane protein MP20 (LIM2), as well as with PMP22 and EMP1, which are known to participate in cell differentiation and signal transduction [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Given its structural similarity to voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma subunits, TMEM114 is hypothesized to be involved in regulating calcium flow across the lens plasma membrane, influencing cellular signaling pathways essential for lens cell function and transparency [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. However, its precise function remains to be determined.

## Cellular Location

Studies using antibody labeling and fluorescent protein tagging have shown that TMEM114 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane, particularly on the lateral and apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells like those in the lens. This plasma membrane localization depends on the presence of N-linked glycosylation [data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf][data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf]. Unlike related proteins such as TMEM235, which is mainly cytoplasmic and partly located at the lateral membrane, TMEM114 remains largely on the cell surface, where it may interact with extracellular components or membrane-associated signaling molecules [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

## Expression Profile

TMEM114 expression is highest in the eye, particularly within the lens epithelium, and is present during both embryonic and postnatal development [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Expression is weak in early embryogenesis, increasing after birth, and is especially concentrated in the anterior and equatorial regions of the lens—areas known for intense cell differentiation and elongation [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Outside the eye, TMEM114 is also found in the brain and testis, reflecting a more tissue-specific pattern compared to some other transmembrane proteins [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Similar expression profiles are seen in model vertebrates such as mouse and Xenopus, strengthening the evidence for its vital role in eye development across species [data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf][data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

## Function and Significance

The precise physiological role of TMEM114 is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence point to its crucial involvement in eye development. Experimental reduction (knockdown) of TMEM114 in *Xenopus tropicalis* embryos leads to microphthalmia, a condition in which the eyes are abnormally small, confirming its importance in vertebrate eye growth and development [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf][data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf]. Genetic studies have identified missense mutations in TMEM114 among patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and congenital cataracts. However, not every case of TMEM114 haploinsufficiency (having only one working copy of the gene) results in lens problems or developmental anomalies, indicating possible variability or compensation by other biological pathways [data\TMEM114\Interstitial deletion at chromosome 16p13.2 involving TMEM114 (transmembrane protein 114) in a boy and his father without cataract.pdf][data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf].

Based on its structure, TMEM114 is also thought to play a role in cell signaling, possibly by regulating calcium movement or forming specialized cell junctions in the lens [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. However, additional research is required to confirm these proposed functions.

## Protein Interactions

TMEM114 has been shown to interact with the tight junction protein ZO-1, with which it partially co-localizes in epithelial cells. However, unlike claudins, which are key structural components of tight junctions, TMEM114 and TMEM235 display minimal co-localization with ZO-1, suggesting a unique—possibly regulatory—role in membrane organization or signaling [data\TMEM114\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].

## Clinical Significance

The association of TMEM114 mutations and chromosomal disruptions with congenital cataracts and eye development disorders highlights the gene's potential clinical importance. Ongoing genetic screening continues to identify sequence variants that may underlie human ocular diseases, suggesting that TMEM114—and possibly its close relatives—could become significant targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic efforts [data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf].

## Summary

In summary, TMEM114 is a transmembrane glycoprotein essential for normal lens development and function. It belongs to a superfamily related to calcium channel regulatory subunits, is specifically located at the plasma membrane of lens epithelial cells, and is vital for healthy eye growth. Mutations or disruptions in TMEM114 may contribute to congenital lens disorders, making it an important gene for both basic research and possible clinical applications [data\TMEM114\out.pdf.pdf][data\TMEM114\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf].
