## GPR179

**GPR179** is a protein found in humans and other vertebrates that plays a crucial role in visual processing, particularly in the retina. It belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and is specifically categorized as a class C orphan GPCR. Mutations in the gene encoding GPR179 are linked to severe visual disorders, most notably complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). These mutations have also been associated with high myopia, a significant risk factor for blindness and other eye diseases [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].

### Genetic Relationships

GPR179 is part of the GPR158/179 group of orphan GPCRs, sharing a close evolutionary relationship with its homolog GPR158. Both proteins form a unique subgroup within the class C GPCRs, which also includes metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRMs), GABA_B receptors, calcium-sensing receptors, taste receptors, and other orphan receptors [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\GPR179\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. GPR179 and GPR158 are found throughout the animal kingdom in all vertebrates. However, GPR179 differs from GPR158 by possessing a calcium-binding EGF-like domain at its N-terminus and numerous repeated CPWE motifs in its C-terminal region—features that are largely absent in GPR158 [data\GPR179\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf].

### Structure

The GPR179 protein has a complex structure composed of 2,367 amino acids, which can be divided into specific regions: a short signal peptide (amino acids 1–25), a large N-terminal extracellular region (amino acids 26–381) containing a calcium-binding EGF-like domain (amino acids 278–324), a seven-helix transmembrane domain (amino acids 382–628), and a long intracellular C-terminal region (amino acids 629–2367) [data\GPR179\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. Similar to other class C GPCRs, GPR179 can form homodimers and possibly heterodimers, which may be vital for its function and for assembling large protein complexes at synaptic sites [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]. Its structure, featuring a large extracellular domain and a seven-transmembrane domain, allows GPR179 to interact with various extracellular and membrane proteins [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].

### Cellular Localization

GPR179 is selectively and highly expressed in the retina, specifically at the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells located in the postsynaptic membrane of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\GPR179\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. Accurate localization to this region is essential for enabling rapid and precise signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells. This mechanism supports the ON visual pathway, which is especially critical for night (scotopic) vision [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].

### Molecular Function

GPR179 primarily serves as a scaffold protein at the postsynaptic membrane of ON-bipolar cells, anchoring and organizing multiple components of the metabotropic signaling cascade involved in visual transduction [data\GPR179\In vitro profiling of orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) constitutive activity.pdf]. It is a central component of a large, approximately 1-megadalton synaptic protein complex that facilitates signal transmission in response to light, particularly under low-light conditions [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].

While the precise details of GPR179's signaling mechanism are still being investigated, evidence suggests that it does not signal through traditional G proteins like other GPCRs. Instead, GPR179 modulates signal transduction by organizing and recruiting regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins—such as RGS7 and RGS11—to the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells. This process is crucial for maintaining the timing and sensitivity of the ON-bipolar cell response to changing photoreceptor inputs [data\GPR179\A New Mouse Model for Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness Due to Gpr179 Deficiency.pdf]; [data\GPR179\Transsynaptic Binding of Orphan Receptor GPR179 to Dystroglycan-Pikachurin Complex Is Essential for the Synaptic Organization of Photoreceptors.pdf]; [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].

### Protein–Protein Interactions

GPR179 interacts with several important proteins within the retinal synaptic complex:

- **RGS Proteins (RGS7, RGS11, Gβ5):** GPR179 is vital for the recruitment of RGS7 and RGS11, as well as the G protein subunit Gβ5, to the postsynaptic site. Loss of GPR179 disrupts the proper localization of these proteins, resulting in defects in visual signal transmission [data\GPR179\A New Mouse Model for Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness Due to Gpr179 Deficiency.pdf]; [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\GPR179\GPR179 Is Required for High Sensitivity of the mGluR6 Signaling Cascade in Depolarizing Bipolar Cells.pdf].
- **mGluR6 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 6):** GPR179 forms complexes with mGluR6, a protein critical for glutamate-mediated signal transmission in ON-bipolar cells [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].
- **TRPM1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1):** GPR179 assists in organizing the placement and function of the TRPM1 channel, which is essential for normal visual responses [data\GPR179\Orphan Receptor GPR179 Forms Macromolecular Complexes With Components of Metabotropic Signaling Cascade in Retina ON-Bipolar Neurons.pdf]; [data\GPR179\GPR179 Is Required for High Sensitivity of the mGluR6 Signaling Cascade in Depolarizing Bipolar Cells.pdf].
- **Pikachurin and Presynaptic Proteins:** GPR179 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein Pikachurin, which is linked to the dystroglycan glycoprotein complex (DGC) in photoreceptors. These connections create trans-synaptic complexes that are critical for proper synaptic architecture and the timing of light-induced responses [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]; [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].

### Clinical Significance

Mutations that disrupt the function of GPR179 lead to congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), characterized by an inability to see in low-light conditions despite having normal vision during the day. The absence or mislocalization of GPR179 prevents RGS proteins from clustering at the dendritic terminals of ON-bipolar cells, resulting in a failure of rapid visual signal transmission that is crucial for night vision. In addition to cCSNB, GPR179 mutations have also been implicated in high myopia, underscoring its broader importance for eye health [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]; [data\GPR179\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.pdf].

### Summary

GPR179 is a key scaffolding and organizing protein in the retina, essential to the function of ON-bipolar cells and the processing of visual signals in low-light conditions. Its unusual structure, specific cellular localization, and extensive network of protein interactions make it indispensable for proper synaptic signaling in the visual system. Disruption of GPR179 results in significant visual impairment, highlighting its vital role in human eye health and disease [data\GPR179\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].
