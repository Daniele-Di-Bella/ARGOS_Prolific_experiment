It belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and is specifically categorized as a class C orphan GPCR. Mutations in the gene encoding GPR179 are linked to severe visual disorders, most notably complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB). These mutations have also been associated with high myopia, a significant risk factor for blindness and other eye diseases [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].\n\n### Genetic Relationships\n\nGPR179 is part of the GPR158/179 group of orphan GPCRs, sharing a close evolutionary relationship with its homolog GPR158. Both proteins form a unique subgroup within the class C GPCRs, which also includes metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRMs), GABA_B receptors, calcium-sensing receptors, taste receptors, and other orphan receptors [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\\GPR179\\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. GPR179 and GPR158 are found throughout the animal kingdom in all vertebrates. However, GPR179 differs from GPR158 by possessing a calcium-binding EGF-like domain at its N-terminus and numerous repeated CPWE motifs in its C-terminal region—features that are largely absent in GPR158 [data\\GPR179\\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf].\n\n### Structure\n\nThe GPR179 protein has a complex structure composed of 2,367 amino acids, which can be divided into specific regions: a short signal peptide (amino acids 1–25), a large N-terminal extracellular region (amino acids 26–381) containing a calcium-binding EGF-like domain (amino acids 278–324), a seven-helix transmembrane domain (amino acids 382–628), and a long intracellular C-terminal region (amino acids 629–2367) [data\\GPR179\\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. Similar to other class C GPCRs, GPR179 can form homodimers and possibly heterodimers, which may be vital for its function and for assembling large protein complexes at synaptic sites [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]. Its structure, featuring a large extracellular domain and a seven-transmembrane domain, allows GPR179 to interact with various extracellular and membrane proteins [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].\n\n### Cellular Localization\n\nGPR179 is selectively and highly expressed in the retina, specifically at the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells located in the postsynaptic membrane of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\\GPR179\\Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in GPR179 Leading to Autosomal-Recessive Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.pdf]. Accurate localization to this region is essential for enabling rapid and precise signal transmission from photoreceptors to bipolar cells. This mechanism supports the ON visual pathway, which is especially critical for night (scotopic) vision [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].\n\n### Molecular Function\n\nGPR179 primarily serves as a scaffold protein at the postsynaptic membrane of ON-bipolar cells, anchoring and organizing multiple components of the metabotropic signaling cascade involved in visual transduction [data\\GPR179\\In vitro profiling of orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) constitutive activity.pdf]. It is a central component of a large, approximately 1-megadalton synaptic protein complex that facilitates signal transmission in response to light, particularly under low-light conditions [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].\n\nWhile the precise details of GPR179's signaling mechanism are still being investigated, evidence suggests that it does not signal through traditional G proteins like other GPCRs. Instead, GPR179 modulates signal transduction by organizing and recruiting regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins—such as RGS7 and RGS11—to the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells. This process is crucial for maintaining the timing and sensitivity of the ON-bipolar cell response to changing photoreceptor inputs [data\\GPR179\\A New Mouse Model for Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness Due to Gpr179 Deficiency.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\Transsynaptic Binding of Orphan Receptor GPR179 to Dystroglycan-Pikachurin Complex Is Essential for the Synaptic Organization of Photoreceptors.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf].\n\n### Protein–Protein Interactions\n\nGPR179 interacts with several important proteins within the retinal synaptic complex:\n\n- **RGS Proteins (RGS7, RGS11, Gβ5):** GPR179 is vital for the recruitment of RGS7 and RGS11, as well as the G protein subunit Gβ5, to the postsynaptic site. Loss of GPR179 disrupts the proper localization of these proteins, resulting in defects in visual signal transmission [data\\GPR179\\A New Mouse Model for Complete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness Due to Gpr179 Deficiency.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html]; [data\\GPR179\\GPR179 Is Required for High Sensitivity of the mGluR6 Signaling Cascade in Depolarizing Bipolar Cells.pdf].\n- **mGluR6 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 6):** GPR179 forms complexes with mGluR6, a protein critical for glutamate-mediated signal transmission in ON-bipolar cells [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].\n- **TRPM1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 1):** GPR179 assists in organizing the placement and function of the TRPM1 channel, which is essential for normal visual responses [data\\GPR179\\Orphan Receptor GPR179 Forms Macromolecular Complexes With Components of Metabotropic Signaling Cascade in Retina ON-Bipolar Neurons.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\GPR179 Is Required for High Sensitivity of the mGluR6 Signaling Cascade in Depolarizing Bipolar Cells.pdf].\n- **Pikachurin and Presynaptic Proteins:** GPR179 interacts with the extracellular matrix protein Pikachurin, which is linked to the dystroglycan glycoprotein complex (DGC) in photoreceptors. These connections create trans-synaptic complexes that are critical for proper synaptic architecture and the timing of light-induced responses [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.html].\n\n### Clinical Significance\n\nMutations that disrupt the function of GPR179 lead to congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), characterized by an inability to see in low-light conditions despite having normal vision during the day. The absence or mislocalization of GPR179 prevents RGS proteins from clustering at the dendritic terminals of ON-bipolar cells, resulting in a failure of rapid visual signal transmission that is crucial for night vision. In addition to cCSNB, GPR179 mutations have also been implicated in high myopia, underscoring its broader importance for eye health [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]; [data\\GPR179\\Homodimerization of a proximal region within the C-terminus of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR179.pdf].\n\n### Summary\n\nGPR179 is a key scaffolding and organizing protein in the retina, essential to the function of ON-bipolar cells and the processing of visual signals in low-light conditions. Its unusual structure, specific cellular localization, and extensive network of protein interactions make it indispensable for proper synaptic signaling in the visual system. Disruption of GPR179 results in significant visual impairment, highlighting its vital role in human eye health and disease [data\\GPR179\\Cryo-EM structure of human class C orphan GPCR GPR179 involved in visual processing.pdf]."

    "markdown": "# TMEM114\n\n**TMEM114** (Transmembrane Protein 114) is a gene that encodes a membrane-associated protein and has attracted attention due to its significant role in eye development, especially regarding its potential involvement in congenital cataracts. This article explores TMEM114’s genetic relationships, structure, predicted functions, cellular localization, and known protein interactions, with a particular focus on its relevance to eye physiology and disease.\n\n## Discovery and Genetic Relationships\n\nTMEM114 was first identified during the study of a familial chromosomal translocation associated with congenital cataract. Researchers mapped the translocation breakpoint to the TMEM114 gene region on chromosome 16, implicating this gene in eye development and lens transparency [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Subsequent studies have shown that the gene encodes a protein consisting of 223 amino acids, placing TMEM114 in the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 superfamily, which includes proteins typically containing four transmembrane helices [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\Interstitial deletion at chromosome 16p13.2 involving TMEM114 (transmembrane protein 114) in a boy and his father without cataract.pdf]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TMEM114 is more closely related to the voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma subunits (CACNGs) than to classic claudins, which are well-known tight junction proteins [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\nA homologous gene, **TMEM235**, is closely related to TMEM114, sharing both functional and structural similarities. However, TMEM114 and TMEM235 form a distinct branch within the CACNG subfamily of the Pfam00822 protein family, setting them apart from the claudins and other related protein families [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\n## Structure and Predicted Mechanism\n\nTMEM114 encodes a protein featuring four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, a structural motif conserved throughout the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf]. The first extracellular loop contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites, which are essential for the protein’s proper localization to the plasma membrane. Experimental evidence confirms that mutations or enzymatic removal of these glycosylation sites result in mislocalization of TMEM114, highlighting their importance [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\nTMEM114 shares significant sequence similarity with the lens intrinsic membrane protein MP20 (LIM2), as well as with PMP22 and EMP1, which are known to participate in cell differentiation and signal transduction [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Given its structural similarity to voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma subunits, TMEM114 is hypothesized to be involved in regulating calcium flow across the lens plasma membrane, influencing cellular signaling pathways essential for lens cell function and transparency [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. However, its precise function remains to be determined.\n\n## Cellular Location\n\nStudies using antibody labeling and fluorescent protein tagging have shown that TMEM114 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane, particularly on the lateral and apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells like those in the lens. This plasma membrane localization depends on the presence of N-linked glycosylation [data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf]. Unlike related proteins such as TMEM235, which is mainly cytoplasmic and partly located at the lateral membrane, TMEM114 remains largely on the cell surface, where it may interact with extracellular components or membrane-associated signaling molecules [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\n## Expression Profile\n\nTMEM114 expression is highest in the eye, particularly within the lens epithelium, and is present during both embryonic and postnatal development [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Expression is weak in early embryogenesis, increasing after birth, and is especially concentrated in the anterior and equatorial regions of the lens—areas known for intense cell differentiation and elongation [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Outside the eye, TMEM114 is also found in the brain and testis, reflecting a more tissue-specific pattern compared to some other transmembrane proteins [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. Similar expression profiles are seen in model vertebrates such as mouse and Xenopus, strengthening the evidence for its vital role in eye development across species [data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\n## Function and Significance\n\nThe precise physiological role of TMEM114 is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence point to its crucial involvement in eye development. Experimental reduction (knockdown) of TMEM114 in *Xenopus tropicalis* embryos leads to microphthalmia, a condition in which the eyes are abnormally small, confirming its importance in vertebrate eye growth and development [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf]. Genetic studies have identified missense mutations in TMEM114 among patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and congenital cataracts. However, not every case of TMEM114 haploinsufficiency (having only one working copy of the gene) results in lens problems or developmental anomalies, indicating possible variability or compensation by other biological pathways [data\\TMEM114\\Interstitial deletion at chromosome 16p13.2 involving TMEM114 (transmembrane protein 114) in a boy and his father without cataract.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf].\n\nBased on its structure, TMEM114 is also thought to play a role in cell signaling, possibly by regulating calcium movement or forming specialized cell junctions in the lens [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]. However, additional research is required to confirm these proposed functions.\n\n## Protein Interactions\n\nTMEM114 has been shown to interact with the tight junction protein ZO-1, with which it partially co-localizes in epithelial cells. However, unlike claudins, which are key structural components of tight junctions, TMEM114 and TMEM235 display minimal co-localization with ZO-1, suggesting a unique—possibly regulatory—role in membrane organization or signaling [data\\TMEM114\\The cataract-associated protein TMEM114, and TMEM235, are glycosylated transmembrane proteins that are distinct from claudin family members.pdf].\n\n## Clinical Significance\n\nThe association of TMEM114 mutations and chromosomal disruptions with congenital cataracts and eye development disorders highlights the gene's potential clinical importance. Ongoing genetic screening continues to identify sequence variants that may underlie human ocular diseases, suggesting that TMEM114—and possibly its close relatives—could become significant targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic efforts [data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf].\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, TMEM114 is a transmembrane glycoprotein essential for normal lens development and function. It belongs to a superfamily related to calcium channel regulatory subunits, is specifically located at the plasma membrane of lens epithelial cells, and is vital for healthy eye growth. Mutations or disruptions in TMEM114 may contribute to congenital lens disorders, making it an important gene for both basic research and possible clinical applications [data\\TMEM114\\out.pdf.pdf][data\\TMEM114\\Characterization of a familial t(16;22) balanced translocation associated with congenital cataract leads to identification of a novel gene, TMEM114, expressed in the lens and disrupted by the translocation.pdf]."
